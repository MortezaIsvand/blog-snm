## Used Libraries

This blog app utilizes several libraries to enhance its functionality. Here are the main libraries used:

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- Prisma: A database toolkit and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js that simplifies database access and management.
- React Hook Form: A library for building forms in React with easy form validation and state management.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema validation library used for validating form inputs and data.
- DaisyUI: A lightweight UI component library for Tailwind CSS that provides a set of ready-to-use components and utilities.
- NextAuth: A library for handling authentication and authorization in Next.js applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that provides utility classes for styling elements, enabling rapid custom UI development without predefined component classes.

These libraries have been chosen for their reliability, ease of use, and robust feature sets, and they play a crucial role in making this blog app efficient and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mortezaisvand/blog-snm.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```shell
cd blog
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install

4. Set up the environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
NEXT_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=a-random-string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=insert-your-google-client-id-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=insert-your-google-client-secret-here
```
Please replace the placeholders (<insert-...-here>) with your actual values. For instance, replace <insert-your-database-url-here> with the URL of your database. Similarly, replace <insert-your-google-client-id-here> and <insert-your-google-client-secret-here> with your Google Client ID and Secret respectively for session management. The <insert-a-random-string-here> should be replaced with a random string of your choice for NextAuth secret. Remember to keep these values confidential to protect your applicationâ€™s security.
